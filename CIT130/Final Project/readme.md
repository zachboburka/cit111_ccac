<p>My final project models a PNC automated telling machine.</p>
<p>The GUI first displays three buttons: </p>
<li>Deposit</li>
<li>Withdrawl</li>
<li>Exit</li>
<br>
<p>After clicking either the Deposit or Withdrawl buttons, you are given the option to deposit/withdrawl funds
by clicking on buttons labeled with their respective amount.</p>
<p>However, if you need to choose an amount that is not represented by a button, there is a button labeled "Other", that
allows you to enter any dollar amount through a JTextfield.</p>
<p>Although my project is simple, implementing user input into the "Other" button was a challenge. I first had to do some research through 
the Java 8 API and the Liang Textbook to see how this could be done. After this, I browsed several Java forums online to see how other
users implemented this into their software. Through my research, I found that I would have to create a JTextfield, and then take the user 
input and pass it through into an int using .getText() and then Integer.parseInt(), which turns the entered string into an int. This is
a small feature within my program, but accomplishing this was an achievement for me. 
<br>
<p>My final project brings all of the java I have learned through two semesters so far into an complete, working application.</p>
